**Web App Login-Signup Form**
This is a simple login-signup form for a web application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by Firebase for user authentication. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of this form.

**Features**
User registration with email and password.
Email verification for registered users.
User login with registered credentials.
Password reset functionality.
Integration with Firebase for secure user authentication and data storage.
Responsive design for a seamless user experience on different devices.
**Prerequisites**
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

A Firebase project created on the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Firebase SDK configuration details (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) from your Firebase project settings.
Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-web-app.git
cd your-web-app
Open the index.html file and locate the Firebase configuration block. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project's configuration details.

**javascript**
Copy code
var firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
Enable authentication methods in your Firebase project settings (e.g., Email/Password, Google, etc.) as per your requirements.

Deploy your web app to a hosting service of your choice if needed. Firebase Hosting is recommended for seamless Firebase integration.

**Usage**
Visit the deployed web app or open index.html in your web browser.

The login-signup form will be displayed, allowing users to register, log in, or reset their password.

Users can register by providing their email and a password. Firebase will send a verification email to confirm their address.

Users can log in using their registered credentials, or they can use social sign-in options if enabled.

If a user forgets their password, they can request a password reset link sent to their email.

User data will be securely stored in your Firebase project, and you can access and manage user accounts through the Firebase Console.

**Customization**
You can customize the form's appearance and behavior by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed.

Firebase authentication rules can be configured on the Firebase Console to define user access and security rules.

**Dependencies**
This project relies on the following technologies and libraries:

Firebase Authentication: For user authentication.
HTML and CSS: For the structure and styling of the login-signup form.
JavaScript: For form behavior and Firebase integration.
